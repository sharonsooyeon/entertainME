# entertainME
A movie picker that generates entertainment options for people who are unsure of what to watch. 

The GUI is split into two tabs:
  1) AboutPanel and
  2) Movie Calculator.

On start, the program will open up to the About Panel, which details how exactly the user should proceed, including how to input information in the Movie Calculator in order to get the perfect recommendation.

## To run the program
It helps to have a Java IDE. Open `EntertainMEGUI.java` in the IDE and click on "run".
